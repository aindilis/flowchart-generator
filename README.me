Flowchart Generator

A program to generate a flowchart of a contingent plan, for use in
FLP, PrologMUD and SPSE2.  Hope to eventually add ability to select
nodes, mark them complete, and dynamically translate the camera
perspective above the image, to give the illusion of moving forward
like with a GPS.
